# AVRgo Boards and Programmers
AVRgo is a family of boards designed for on-the-go and in-the-field applications. Their bluetooth capability allows sketches to be uploaded and debugged via a multitude of devices without using wires, eg computer, smartphone, tablet, etc. The AVRgo-SerialBTx is a bluetooth programmer/debugger designed to give these capabilities to virtually all Arduino compatible AVRs that use a serial bootloader.

## AVRgo Boards
#### AVRgo-Infinity
The AVRgo-Infinity originated with two primary goals. To be completely cordless and to be a board built with EVERYBODY in mind. It's not a design for beginners or for advanced users. It's a design that grows with you, from beginner to advanced user and can be picked up anywhere in between. Whether your're designing the next wearable device, an AVR-based handheld gaming system, or just learning how to turn on LEDs; The AVRgo-Infinity is designed for you. The library we developed to accompany this board is extensive, and it makes complicated tasks incredibly easy.
- Dual Bootloader allows for uploading sketches via Micro-SD Card, or directly from the Arduino IDE over Bluetooth.
- The Bluetooth Electronics App allows you to control your AVRgo-Infinity and select sketches via any android device (examples provided).
- The ArduinoDroid App allows you to compile and upload sketches directly from any Android device (under development)
- Dual mode Bluetooth broadcasts both SPP and BLE, which can be connected to different devices simultaneuosly.
- Built in Micro-SD card slot with BinStacking capabilities (flashing sketches via Serial Command Line or from within another sketch)
- Integrated RGB LED allows for a customized look, as well as displaying information visually
- More on-board features, along with an extensive library allows for much greater capabilies than other developement boards, while requiring much less effort and/or experience.
- The internal LiPo battery with built-in charger provides more than enough power for most projects, wherever you need it.
- Triple Battery Protection Circuit allows for safe and optimal use of the LiPo battery by even the most inexperienced users.
  - Redundant Low Voltage Cutoff ensures the battery never drops to an unsafe voltage.
  - 900/1800mA Polyfuse disconnects the battery if current is exessively high (such as a short to ground) and can be reset by turning the board off for a few seconds.
  - Safe Storage Zener diode automatically prevents the battery from being maintained above the Safe Storage Window (3.3-3.8V) for more than 48 hours (when not plugged in), by slowly draining current when voltage is above 3.8V (Â±2%).
- LiPo Self-Discharge rate is less than 1% per month when within the Safe Storage Window
- Integrated charging LEDs let you know when the battery is fully charged
- 3.3V regulated operating voltage.
- Up to 200mA output current by default, with an additional 500mA available on-board by soldering the Boost jumper pads closed.
- Sleep current as low as 1uA (most of which is the battery protection circuit)
- 8mHz internal clock with convenient external clock capabilities
- 120kB Flash Memory
- 16kB Ram
- 4kB EEPROM


## AVRgo Programmers
#### AVRgo-SerialBTx
The AVRgo-SerialBTx is a bluetooth programmer/debugger that allows virtually any Arduino Compatible Development Board to essentially become an AVRgo. A short listing of features and specifications are as follows...
- Ability to upload sketches via bluetooth to virtually any AVR based development board with a serial bootloader, using a computer, phone or tablet
- Ability to run Serial Monitor wirelessly, makes debugging a breeze
- Supports 3.3V of 5V operating voltage
- Simple to setup and operate

# Installing AVRgo in the Arduino IDE
