# AVRgo Boards and Programmers
AVRgo is a family of boards designed for on-the-go and in-the-field applications. The AVRgo-SerialBTx is a bluetooth programmer designed to give these capabilities to virtually all Arduino compatible AVRs that use a serial bootloader.

## AVRgo Boards
#### AVRgo-Infinity
The AVRgo-Infinity is the flagship board of the AVRgo family. It can be powered by its internal LiPo Battery or through the 5V USB port. A short listing of features and specifications are as follows...
- Internal 500mAh LiPo battery with built-in charger
- Dual low-voltage cutoff circuits prevent battery damage due to over-discharge
- External Battery Expansion Port effortlessly allows connecting additional LiPo batteries in parallel for a higher overall capacity.
- 3.3V regulated operating voltage.
- Up to 200mA output current when powered by battery and 700mA when powered by the 5V USB port
- Built in Micro-SD card slot 
- Dual Bootloader allows for uploading sketches via bluetooth or by loading them onto a Micro-SD card.
- Uses ATMEGA1284P AVR
- 8mHz Clock
- 120kB Flash Memory
- 16kB Ram
- 4kB EEPROM
#### AVRgo-Switch
The AVRgo-Switch is a powerful developement board with a selectable operating voltage. It can be run at either 3.3V or 5V with the flip of a switch, making it one of the most versatile development board in existence. A short listing of features and specifications are as follows...
- Breadboard-friendly design makes projects a breeze
- Selectable 3.3V or 5V regulated operating voltage virtually eliminates any need for level-shifters
- Up to 800mA output current at either operating voltage
- Built in Micro-SD card slot 
- Dual Bootloader allows for uploading sketches via bluetooth or by loading them onto a Micro-SD card.
- Uses ATMEGA1284P AVR
- 8mHz Clock
- 120kB Flash Memory
- 16kB Ram
- 4kB EEPROM
#### AVRgo-Vitality
The AVRgo-Switch is designed for low-drain battery powered applications, uch as wearables. While its 10mAh output current may seem incredibly low, it's actually more than enough for most simple projects (operating current is often not considered). A short listing of features and specifications are as follows...
- Can be powered by either the non-rechargeable CR2032 or rechargeable ML2032 coin cell
- The ultra-low self-discharge rate of coin cells and ultra-low sleep current of the AVR allows your project to run up to 10 years or longer on a single charge
- Low-battery indicator light helps prevent battery damage due to over-discharge (ML2032), while maintaining ultra-low power consumption
- Bootloader allows sketches to be uploaded via on-board bluetooth
- Uses ATMEGA328PB AVR
- 8mHz Clock
- 30kB Flash Memory
- 2kB Ram
- 1kB EEPROM
